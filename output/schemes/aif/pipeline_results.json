This further will make farmers independent and improve access to market.\n3)\tWith modern packaging and cold storage system access, farmers will be able to further decide when to sell in the market and improve realization.\n4)\tCommunity farming assets for improved productivity and optimization of inputs will result in substantial savings to farmers.\n5)\tGovernment will be able to direct priority sector lending in the currently unviable projects by supporting through interest subvention, incentive and credit guarantee. This will initiate the cycle of innovation and private sector investment in agriculture.\n6)\tDue to improvements in postharvest infrastructure, government will further be able to reduce national food wastage percentage thereby enable agriculture sector to become competitive with current global levels.\n7)\tCentral/State Government Agencies or local bodies will be able to structure viable PPP projects for attracting investment in agriculture infrastructure.\n8)\tWith Credit Guarantee, incentive and interest subvention lending institutions will be able to lend with a lower risk.

The financing facility will be provided for funding Agriculture Infrastructure Projects at farm-gate &amp; aggregation points to agri entrepreneurs, farmers, Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies, Farmers Producer Organizations, Start-ups, state agencies, state sponsored Public Private partnerships, etc.\n\n\nAll scheduled commercial banks, scheduled cooperative banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) may participate to provide this financing facility, after signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with National Bank for Agriculture &amp; Rural Development (NABARD)/DA&amp;FW. If required, need based refinance support will be made available by NABARD to all eligible lending entities including cooperative banks and RRBs as per its policy.\n\n\nThe key objective of the scheme is to mobilize a medium to long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management Infrastructure and community farming assets through incentives and financial support in order to improve agriculture infrastructure in the country.\nThe scheme covers post-harvest management projects like supply chain services including e-marketing platforms, warehouse, silos, pack-houses, assaying units, sorting &amp; grading units, cold chain, logistics facilities, primary processing centers, ripening chambers and other viable projects for building community farming assets such as organic input production, bio stimulant production units, infrastructure for smart and precision agriculture, supply chain infrastructure for clusters of crops including exports clusters etc.\nAll loans up to a limit of \u20b9 2 crores under this financing facility will have interest subvention of 3% per annum. This subvention will be available for a maximum period of 7 years. An applicant can put up to 25 projects in different locations and each of such projects will be eligible under the scheme for loan upto \u20b9 2 crore. Under the scheme, it is mandatory for borrowers to contribute at least 10% of total project cost irrespective of available capital subsidy. Multiple projects in one location are also eligible with an overall cap of \u20b92 crore. In case, one eligible entity puts up projects in different locations then all such projects will be eligible under the scheme for loan upto \u20b92 crore.

This will improve the overall income of farmers.\n2)\tWith investments in logistics infrastructure, farmers will be able to sell in the market with reduced postharvest losses and a smaller number of intermediaries. This further will make farmers independent and improve access to market.\n3)\tWith modern packaging and cold storage system access, farmers will be able to further decide when to sell in the market and improve realization.\n4)\tCommunity farming assets for improved productivity and optimization of inputs will result in substantial savings to farmers.\n5)\tGovernment will be able to direct priority sector lending in the currently unviable projects by supporting through interest subvention, incentive and credit guarantee. This will initiate the cycle of innovation and private sector investment in agriculture.\n6)\tDue to improvements in postharvest infrastructure, government will further be able to reduce national food wastage percentage thereby enable agriculture sector to become competitive with current global levels.\n7)\tCentral/State Government Agencies or local bodies will be able to structure viable PPP projects for attracting investment in agriculture infrastructure.\n8)\tWith Credit Guarantee, incentive and interest subvention lending institutions will be able to lend with a lower risk.
