    "description": "The name of this welfare scheme is Atal Sneh Yojana. It is also known as ASYG. Detailed \nAtal Sneh Yojana in Gujarat is the scheme that has launched on the 25th of December 2016 on the occasion of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s ninety-second birthday. The scheme is launched by the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Vijay Rupani. The scheme will look forward to a healthy child after their birth. It was decided at the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital and it will look upon the children up to two months after their birth.\nAfter focusing on the health of the children and covering some major diseases the government has now shifted its focus to core issues. Basically, the Atal Sneh Yojana will replace the decades-old Annual School Program which was being carried out by the health and education departments.\nFor this new scheme, newborn children will be screened specifically to look for health defects and improve them. This is being launched wide across Gujarat. Under this scheme, the newborn kids will be screened and given treatment immediately if there is any illness found. It will be carried out for two long months.\nObjectives \n\n   1. Through this scheme, children can be provided with better health. Better health will lead to avoiding malnutrition, disorders, and diseases.\n   1.
