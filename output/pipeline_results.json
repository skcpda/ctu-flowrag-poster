    "description": "The name of this welfare scheme is 25% Capital Investment Subsidy Scheme. It is also known as 25%CISS. Introduction:\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep has been declared as the \u201cNo industrial Area\u201d and hence no scope for establishing major Industries in this UT. The Govt. of India is giving significant emphasis on setting up Small-Scale Industrial units for the economic development of the Islands in order to create self-employment/ job opportunities considering the lack of employment in the Government Sector under the U.T. Administration. Specific studies were conducted by the Planning Commission in pursuance of the decision taken by the Standing Committee of the Island Development Authority and constituted an Expert Committee. The Committee learned about problems of Industrialization in these Islands and identified special needs that would accelerate the Start-up Industries in Lakshadweep. Based on the recommendation of the expert committee, Govt. of India has approved the implementation of a scheme called 25% Capital Investment Subsidy to the local entrepreneurs for promoting Micro and Small Enterprises in Lakshadweep.
