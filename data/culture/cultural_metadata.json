    "Santal inhabitants having low or no\neducational background also have changed their\nprofession owing to shortfall of traditional resources,\nand also as there is better openings in other sectors",
    "Moreover the\nperiodical small markets of this community are\npresently linked with the bigger markets; therefore\nthis has introduced a number of new innovative\noccupations in the Santal economy",
    "Murmu saw his script as a gift of the deities, and several stories tell us how\nhe rediscovered the script, which had been forgotten or even stolen, provoking\nthe cultural amnesia of the Santals",

    "Land Rights and Dispossession \nLand rights have been a longstanding and pressing concern for the North Santal community, and this issue persists \ndespite existing legal protections (Gerharz, 2014)",
    "48 The pattern of domination is\nreflected here: that of the non-tribal (diku) (and also the inner diku) who\nusurps power or manipulates the deities (bongas) to take advantage of his\nSantal brothers",

    "As the Manjhi is the \nsupreme of their traditional self-governing system and this self-governing system is intermixed with religion and faith, \nso entire community has faith in the post of the Manjhi",
    "Skrefsrud (1968 \n[1887]) collected lengthy narratives of the creation myth and Santal traditions, related to him \nby Kolean Guru in 1871, and published in Santali as Horkoren Mare Hapramko reak\u00b4 Katha",
