The name of this welfare scheme is Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahabhiyan Scheme For Farmers.. It is also known as PM-KUSUM. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Surakshaevam Utthaan Mahabhiyan Yojana (PM-KUSUM Scheme) was launched in March 2019 by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), to subsidize farmers to install solar irrigation pumps for cultivation. Each farmer will receive a 60% subsidy to set up tube wells and pump sets. They will also get 30% of the total cost as a loan from the Government.


The primary objective of the PM KUSUM Scheme is to make cutting-edge technology available to our farmers and provide sources for de-dieselized irrigation to the agricultural sector. The main objectives of this scheme are:

1. The solar pumps assist our farmers in much more effective and eco-friendly irrigation as these are capable of generating safer energy.
1. In addition, the pump sets comprise an energy power grid that generates more energy than diesel-driven pumps. Farmers will be able to sell the extra power to our Government directly to enhance their income.
