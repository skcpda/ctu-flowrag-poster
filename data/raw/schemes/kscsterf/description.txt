The name of this welfare scheme is KSCSTE Research Fellowship. It is also known as KSCSTERF. The scheme “KSCSTE Research Fellowship” is for encouraging enthusiastic and passionate post-graduate science/ engineering students by supporting them financially in their Ph.D. studies. There are seven science streams in which the students can opt for fellowship. They are Mathematical Sciences, Life Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Physical Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Environmental Sciences, and Earth-Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.
Under the scheme, the fellows are selected based on a rigorous online examination among bright post-graduate students. The following is the pattern of examination:
There are two papers for the entrance examination:

  - Paper A is general which evaluates the candidate’s general knowledge and research aptitude.
  - Paper B is the subject paper. The syllabus for paper B is similar to that of the CSIR examination and this will be available on the KSCSTE website.
