The name of this welfare scheme is Free Education For Sports Medal Winners / Participants Of National/ International Events. It is also known as FESMWPNIE. INTRODUCTION 
Sports are not an only institutional competitive activity but also help in educating the youths regarding their behavior and their qualities to help in their social and emotional adjustment with the society at large irrespective of culture, religion, or beliefs. It is not only a method of recreational growth and development but also helps in the integration of youth with the countryâ€™s social order.


To bring laurels to the country and for personal and professional development in sports, the youth have to not only spend their time but also their limited resources to excel.
