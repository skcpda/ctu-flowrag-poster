The name of this welfare scheme is Back-To-Lab Post-Doctoral Fellowship Programme. It is also known as BTLPDFP. The “Back-to-Lab” programme of the Women Scientists Division offers Research and Post-Doctoral Fellowship to women who have a break in their career, to facilitate their re-entry in science research. The fellowship is provided normally for a period of 2 years. The scheme is open to unemployed women who are permanent residents of Kerala and qualified with PhD in Science or Engineering. The objective of the scheme is to support women having career breaks, facilitating their re-entry in scientific research by providing a Post-Doctoral Fellowship.
        Back-To-Lab Post-Doctoral Fellowship Programme is aimed to support women in Science in Kerala. The programme focuses on addressing the issue of the under-representation of women in higher academics and professions particularly in Science. The programme will facilitate the re-entry of women in Science after a career break necessitated due to family commitments. Active participation of more number of women in Science is socially relevant and significant, especially in a developing economy. Further, the programme would benefit qualitative interventions in Science research by effective utilization of human resource potential.
