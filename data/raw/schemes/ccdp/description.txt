The name of this welfare scheme is Crop Cluster Development Programme. It is also known as Ccdp. The Crop Cluster Development Programme (CCDP) in Baagwani Villages is a comprehensive scheme focused on the development of backward and forward integration in horticulture farming. The program aims to enhance farmer socio-economic security, achieve nutritional security, establish transparent institutional delivery mechanisms, generate rural employment, increase horticultural crop area and productivity, and develop organized marketing of horticultural products. It addresses the challenges faced by small farmers in selling to modern markets, such as supermarkets and large retailers, by promoting the collectivization of produce through farmer groups and educating them about modern technologies.
 The CCDP emphasizes the need for a coordinated supply chain, including aggregation of produce, market linkages, access to quality inputs and agro-services, and post-harvest management infrastructure. By facilitating access to fair and remunerative markets and ensuring adherence to global standards, the program aims to achieve the goals of quality, quantity, and seamless delivery. It is specifically implemented in Arunachal Pradesh. Additionally, the nodal department is Agriculture and Marketing Department.
