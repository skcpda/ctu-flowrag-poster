The name of this welfare scheme is Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana. It is also known as PMAGY. With a view to enabling an area-based development approach, a new scheme Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) was launched during 2009-10. The Scheme aims at integrated development of Scheduled Castes majority villages.


The principal objective of PMAGY is the integrated development of SC majority Villages:
(a) Primarily through convergent implementation of the relevant Central and State/UT Government Schemes; and
(b) By taking up identified activities, which do not get covered under the existing Central and State Government Schemes, through ‘Gap-filling’ funds provided as Central Assistance to the extent of ₹20,00,000 per village.


The implementation of the Scheme was started on Pilot basis in 2009-10 and a total of 1000 villages was selected from 05 States namely Tamil Nadu (225), Rajasthan (225), Bihar (225), Himachal Pradesh (225) and Assam (100) were selected for this phase. All these 1000 villages have so far been declared as ‘Adarsh Gram’ by the respective State Governments.


> The vision of an ‘Adarsh Gram&#39;

An ‘Adarsh Gram’ is one wherein people have access to various basic services so that the minimum needs of all the sections of society are fully met and disparities are reduced to a minimum. These villages would have all such infrastructure and their residents will have access to all such basic services that are necessary for a dignified living, creating thereby an environment in which everyone is enabled to utilize her/his potential to the fullest. The scheme targets beneficiaries such as State Government. Additionally, the nodal ministry is Ministry Of Social Justice and Empowerment and the nodal department is Department of Social Justice & Empowerment.

It falls under the categories: Agriculture,Rural & Environment.

Eligibility criteria include: Out of the villages having more than 50% SC population, only those with a total population greater than 500 will be eligible for selection in descending order of their SC population in the first instance under the Scheme.
(As per the Census 2011, there are 46844 villages having more than 50% Scheduled Castes population. These villages are spread over 570 districts of 25 States &amp; UTs.)
