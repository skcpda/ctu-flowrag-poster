The name of this welfare scheme is Varnam Scheme For Transgender Students Pursuing Distance Education Courses. It is also known as VSTSPDEC. The scheme “Varnam Scheme for Transgender Students Pursuing Distance Education Courses” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala.
