National Horticulture Mission (NHM) was launched in the year 2005-06 and aims at the holistic development of the horticulture sector by ensuring forward and backward linkage through a cluster approach with the active participation of all stakeholders. Major interventions under NHM include, supply of quality planting material through establishment of nurseries and tissue culture units, production and productivity improvement programmes through area expansion and rejuvenation, technology promotion, technology dissemination, human resource development, creation of infrastructure for post harvest management and marketing in consonance with the comparative advantages of each State/region and their diverse agro-climatic conditions.


Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH) aims to achieve overall development of Horticulture in NE and Himalayan states. The mission covers all NE States including Sikkim and three Himalayan states of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.


Executive Committee of MIDH decides the annual outlay to various implementing agencies (SHMs and NLAs). Accordingly, implementing agencies submit an Annual Action Plan (AAP) for the approval supported with data/write up on outcome of past interventions and also covering the details of various interventions proposed to be taken up during the current financial year. While finalizing the AAPs, due attention is paid for earmarking specific targets for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and women beneficiaries. As an inbuilt provision under MIDH scheme, higher rates of subsidy have been envisaged for taking up activities like creation of infrastructure for post-harvest management and marketing of horticulture produce along with area expansion by beneficiaries in the North Eastern States, Himalayan States, Tribal Sub Plan areas, Andaman &amp; Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands.
