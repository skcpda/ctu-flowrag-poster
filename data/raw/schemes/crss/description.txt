The name of this welfare scheme is Supporting Community Radio Movement in India. It is also known as CRSS. Community Radio is a form of local broadcasting that focuses on the needs and interests of a community. The Community Radio is an important third tier in Radio Broadcasting, distinct from Akashwani and Private FM Radio. The Community Radio is built on the principles of access, participation and the ability to represent one’s voice. It provides a platform to communities to air their voices on issues concerning their lives. The Community Radios are essentially low power FM Radio stations (having a coverage in the range of 5- 10 Kms radius) that are meant to be owned, set up and operated by not-for profit community based organizations and its contents are produced by and for the members of the community.
&lt;br&gt;

The Policy
In December 2002, the Government of India approved a policy for the grant of licenses for setting up of Community Radio Stations to well established educational institutions including IITs/IIMs. The matter was reconsidered in the year 2006 and the Government decided to broad base the policy by bringing ‘Non-profit’ organisations like civil society and voluntary organisations etc, under its ambit in order to allow greater participation by the civil society on issues relating to development &amp;amp; social change. Currently, not-for profit organizations/ institutions such as Educational Institutions, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, ICAR Institutions, NGOs, registered societies, public charitable trusts etc. are eligible to apply for setting up CRS.  As on 28.05.2024 there are 495 operational CRS across the country.
