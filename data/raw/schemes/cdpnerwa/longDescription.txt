criteria for applicants under this scheme?", "answer": "Eligibility involves being a tribal grower without prior Water Augmentation subsidies during the XII plan period and possessing land records certified by Village/State Authorities.\n"}, {"question": "What activities are deemed eligible for subsidy under this scheme?", "answer": "Installing water storage tanks, open wells, and irrigation equipment like sprinklers or drip systems to boost coffee production and quality qualify for subsidies.\n"}, {"question": "What's the subsidy percentage available for water harvesting structures and sprinkler units?", "answer": "The subsidy is set at 75% of the unit cost, capped at a maximum of \u20b91.25 lakh for all related activities combined.\n"}, {"question": "Can you explain the construction specifics for water storage tanks in this scheme?", "answer": "Water storage tanks can be constructed either above or below ground level, with different subsidy considerations based on the type of tank.\n"}, {"question": "What are the specifications for the location of water augmentation structures under this scheme?", "answer": "Water augmentation structures should be situated on the estate or within its vicinity to qualify for the subsidies.\n"}, {"question": "Is it possible for growers to claim subsidies for water harvesting structures and irrigation equipment at different times?", "answer": "Yes, growers have the option to claim subsidies for these structures and equipment either simultaneously or at different times.\n"}, {"question": "Could you outline the documents required for claiming the subsidy?", "answer": "The required documents include an application in duplicate, the original invoice/bill with TIN No. for sprinkler/drip equipment, and a work completion report signed by the applicant.\n"}, {"question": "What considerations are there for amendments to this scheme?", "answer": "The acceptance of an application doesn't assure subsidy approval due to fund availability, and the Coffee Board holds the right to modify terms for efficient execution.\n"}, {"question": "What consequences exist for applicants involved in bribery or misleading practices?", "answer": "Applicants engaged in such malpractices face rejection, potential legal action for recovery, and strict consequences under the scheme's terms and conditions.\n\n\n\n"}, {"question": "How is the subsidy amount calculated for water storage tanks, specifically the above-ground and below-ground constructions?", "answer": "For below-ground tanks, subsidies are based on the lower value between dimension and unit cost, while for above-ground tanks, it's the lower value between actual cost and the unit cost applicable to below-ground tanks.\n"}, {"question": "What's the role of the Extension Officer in the subsidy claiming process?", "answer": "The Extension Officer scrutinizes documents, conducts field inspections, and forwards application reports and verification to the Joint Director (Extension) or Deputy Director for subsidy approval or rejection.\n"}, {"question": "What actions lead to the release of the eligible subsidy to the beneficiary?",
