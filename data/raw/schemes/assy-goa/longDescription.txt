These documents collectively serve as evidence to verify the eligibility of the applicant and the deceased."}, {"question": "What is the maximum financial assistance offered under this scheme?", "answer": "The scheme provides financial assistance of up to \u20b9 20,000 or the actual cost, whichever is less, to cover the expenses associated with the funeral and religious ceremonies of Scheduled Tribe families."}, {"question": "Could you provide insights into the special case scenario mentioned in the scheme?", "answer": "Certainly.

This ensures that eligible individuals, even if not from a Scheduled Tribe background, can access the benefits if they can prove their relationship with the deceased."}, {"question": "What are the documents required to prove the annual income eligibility criterion?", "answer": "To establish that the annual family income does not exceed \u20b9 3,00,000, applicants need to submit an Income Certificate issued by the Competent Authority. This certificate verifies their income status and ensures compliance with the scheme's income threshold."}, {"question": "How does the scheme determine the actual cost of funeral and religious ceremonies?", "answer": "The scheme allows financial assistance of up to \u20b9 20,000 or the actual cost, whichever is less. The \"Vouchers Receipts\" document is significant here, as it serves as a record of expenses incurred during the ceremonies, enabling accurate calculation of assistance based on actual costs."}, {"question": "Can you provide insights into the \"Sanctioning Authority\" and the decision-making process within the scheme?", "answer": "The Director of Tribal Welfare scrutinizes the applications in the prescribed manner.

Any difficulties in implementation are resolved by a state-level committee, ensuring transparency and fair decision-making."}, {"question": "Can you explain the significance of the \"Mandate Form\" among the required documents?", "answer": "The \"Mandate Form\" is essential as it provides the necessary authorization for the financial assistance to be transferred to the beneficiary's bank account.
