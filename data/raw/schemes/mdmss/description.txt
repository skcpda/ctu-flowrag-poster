The name of this welfare scheme is Mid Day Meals Scheme. It is also known as Mdmss. The Mid Day Meals Scheme (MDM) is a welfare program introduced by the government to address the issues of hunger, malnutrition, and low school attendance among children. The scheme aims to provide free and nutritious meals to school children across the country. Under this initiative, a hot cooked meal is served to children in primary and upper primary schools.
