The name of this welfare scheme is SERB Research Scientist Scheme . It is also known as SERBRSS. The INSPIRE Faculty Scheme of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Ramanujan Fellowship Scheme of the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) offer opportunities for young scientists to initiate and sustain research careers in various fields of science and engineering.
