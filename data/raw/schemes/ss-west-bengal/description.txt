The name of this welfare scheme is Shikshashree Scheme. It is also known as SS-WEST BENGAL. The scheme &amp;quot;Shikshashree Scheme” was implemented by the Government of West Bengal during 2014-15 by merging the existing schemes of Book Grants &amp;amp; Maintenance Grants to provide financial assistance to Schedule Caste students studying in classes V to VIII.
       Formerly, day-scholar students of classes V-VIII belonging to the Scheduled Caste category enjoyed two grants namely a) assistance in the form of a book grant and b) assistance in the form of a maintenance grant. The number of such grants was meager and did not serve the intended purpose. Further, the method of selection of candidates and that of disbursements is cumbersome and time-consuming. In order to do away with these predicaments inherent in the scheme and to provide quality assistance to Schedule Caste (SC) students of Classes V to VIII in a smooth, transparent, and efficient way, a new scheme of providing assistance to the target group is being formulated in the name of &amp;quot;Shikshashree Scheme&amp;quot;.
          The &amp;quot;Shikshashree Scheme&amp;quot; scheme of providing assistance to SC day scholars of Class V-VIII is evolved by merging the existing schemes of Book Grants and Maintenance Grants. It is applicable to the day scholars of West Bengal reading in class V-VIII in any Government, Government-aided and all Government recognized schools of West Bengal.
