Selection procedure:
Stage 1: Submission and Evaluation of Pre – Proposal
Step 01: Submission of PreProposal: Once the call for proposal is notified, the PI has to initially submit the Preproposal for the proposed research fitting into the identified domain themes/subthemes, as explained above, online.
Step 02: Scrutiny of the Preproposal: Upon receiving the preproposal, acknowledgement with a reference number will be issued to the PI through email and SMS. The project proposal will be scrutinized thereafter. Complete proposals with all the relevant documents will proceed further for Peer Review and the incomplete proposals will not be processed further and summarily rejected.
Step 03: Peer Review of PreProposal: The preproposal will be forwarded to 3 subject experts for peer review. The preproposal will be evaluated based on an Evaluation Matrix containing 7 criteria (scores from 5 to 0), as per the following criteria:	
0: Fails to address the criteria cannot be evaluated.
1: Poor: The criterion is inadequately addressed and there are serious inherent weaknesses.
2: Fair: Broadly addresses the criterion, but there are serious inherent weaknesses.
3: Good: The proposal addresses the criterion well, but there are several shortcomings.
4: Very Good: The proposal addresses the criterion well, but a few shortcomings are found.
5: Excellent: The proposal addresses the criterion well, no shortcomings as such are found.
Step 04: Screening Procedure after Scoring: The reviewers will assign suitable scores based on the review of the preproposals. Based on review reports from reviewers, the proposals will be ranked based on the score points. Only 50% of the proposals that secure higher than 60% score points (average of scores by subject experts) will be considered to proceed to the next stage for submitting detailed proposals and others will be rejected. The PIs of the selected proposals will be intimated about the submission of detailed proposals.
Stage 2: Submission and Evaluation of Detailed Proposal
Step 01: Submission of Detailed Proposal: The PIs of the selected preproposals will be informed to submit the detailed Proposals online within the stipulated time frame.
Step 02: Scrutiny and Peer Review: The detailed Project Proposals will be scrutinized and sent to the referees for peer review. The proposal will be sent to five nationallevel experts in the concerned field for peer review. Based on the review reports from referees, the recommended proposals will be placed in the Programme Advisory Committee for YIPB (PACYIPB) for final decision.
Step 03: Presentation before the Programme Advisory Committee (PAC): The PI/CoIs will be invited to present the proposal before the PAC. PAC is a highlevel Committee comprising of National Level Experts and constituted by KBC. The Council assesses the objectives, scope, content and social relevance of the proposed project and recommends the nature and quantum of assistance to be provided to the approved project. The decision made by KBC based on the recommendations of PAC on such a proposal shall be final.
