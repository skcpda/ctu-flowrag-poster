The name of this welfare scheme is NIJASHAREE HOUSING SCHEME. It is also known as NHS- WEST BENGAL. The Government of West Bengal is determined to provide a `Basha’ (house) to all the people belonging to the Lower Income Group (LIG) and the Middle Income Group (MIG). There is a growing demand for housing amongst families belonging to the low and middle-income categories. In order to cater to the housing needs of the Lower Income Group and the Middle Income Group, the Housing Department felt the need to make provisions for affordable housing, and decided to introduce a new Housing Scheme, namely &amp;quot;NIJASHREE HOUSING SCHEME&amp;quot;.
Salient Features of The Scheme:

- The scheme envisages the construction of dwelling units of a minimum of 16 flats in a block of G + 3 buildings on the government lands, lands of local bodies, and other parastatals.
- 1BHK flats, with a minimum built-up area of 35.15 square meters (378 sq. ft.), will be constructed for the LIG category, and 2BHK flats, having a minimum built-up area of 50.96 square meters (559 sq. ft.), will be constructed for the MIG category.
- The unit cost will be determined on the basis of the actual cost of construction of the superstructure, substructure, and internal infrastructure including sanitary and plumbing, internal electrification, etc., incidental therein.
- No cost of land shall be taken into account while computing the unit cost. This freehold land will be treated as a subsidy to the beneficiary.
- The unit cost and standard built-up area may vary, depending on the location and quantum of the land available, as well as the land development cost and the schedule of rates applicable to the area, at the time of construction.
- Off-site infrastructure like the construction of internal roads, boundary wall, outside electrification, making of a drainage system, installation of lights in the campus and water supply shall not be added to the cost of the housing development scheme NIJASHREE, i.e., the purchaser will not have to pay for such infrastructure.
