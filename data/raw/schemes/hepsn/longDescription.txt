To provide equal educational opportunities to differently-abled persons in higher education institutions.\n1. To create awareness among the functionaries of higher education about the specific educational needs of differently-abled persons. \n1. To equip higher education institutions with the facilities to provide access to differently-abled persons.\n1.

They are enumerated as follows: \n> **Component 1: Establishment of Enabling Units for differently-abled Persons** \n\nTo develop awareness in the higher education system and also to provide necessary guidance and counseling to differently-abled persons, it is proposed to establish resource units in colleges in the country, which will be called Enabling Units. The functions of this Enabling Unit will be to: \n1. Facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses; \n2. Provide guidance and counseling to differently-abled individuals; \n3. Create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning; and \n4. Assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors. \nThe special unit will be coordinated by a faculty member to be nominated by the head of the institution. He/she will work as an honorary coordinator for which a token honorarium of Rs. 4000/- per month will be paid. The unit will also have a budgetary provision of \u20b9 50,000/per year towards general administration, stationery, and contingencies, and to avail the services of experts and personnel for organizing awareness programs, counseling sessions, etc., for efficient and independent functioning in order to achieve its objectives.\n<br>\n\n> **Component 2: Providing Access to Differently-abled Persons**\n\n\n1. The UGC will make a one-time grant of up to \u20b9 5,00,000 per college during the Plan period so that the colleges can address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability and make special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning.\n1. The colleges address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995.\n1. The colleges ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly. \n1. The institutes create special facilities such as ramps, rails, and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled\u00a0persons.\n\n<br>\n\n> **Component 3: Providing Special Equipment to Augment Educational Services for Differently-abled Persons** \n\nDifferently-abled persons require special aids and appliances for their daily functioning. These aids are available through various schemes of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. In addition to the procurement of assistive devices through these schemes, higher education institutions may also need special learning and assessment devices to help differently-abled students enrolled in higher education. In addition, visually challenged students need Readers. Availability of devices such as computers with screen reading software, low-vision aids, scanners, mobility devices, etc., in the institutes, would enrich the educational experiences of differently-abled persons. Therefore, colleges are encouraged to procure such devices and provide the facility of Readers for visually challenged students.
