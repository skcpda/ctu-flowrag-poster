The identity card serves as a unique identification number for eligibility verification."}, {"question": "What are the ceiling limits and eligibility criteria for small tea growers to obtain equipment like the Pruning Machine and Mechanical Harvester under the PDSTG component?", "answer": "Small tea growers are eligible for equipment under the PDSTG component. The ceiling limit for a Pruning Machine is \u20b930,000, and one machine is allowed for each or up to 5.00 hectares of tea area. For the Mechanical Harvester, the ceiling limit is \u20b925,000 for a Single Man Harvester and \u20b940,000 for a Double Man Harvester. Eligibility for the Mechanical Harvester is for each or up to 10.00 hectares of tea area."}, {"question": "Could you elaborate on the specific components of the TDPS and how they contribute to the Indian tea industry's growth and sustainability?", "answer": "He TDPS comprises seven major components, each serving distinct purposes within the Indian tea industry. These components are designed to protect, grow, and sustain the industry. One such component is \"Plantation Development for Small Tea Growers (PDSTG),\" which aims to boost the production and quality of tea and help small growers move up the value chain. Sustainability is addressed through the promotion of organic and climate-resilient tea. Another component focuses on the mechanization for individual small growers."}, {"question": "Could you explain what \"Self-declaration under PPC compliance\" entails and why it's a part of the required documents?", "answer": "Self-declaration under PPC compliance refers to an assurance by the applicant that they are compliant with all relevant laws and regulations, particularly those related to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. It serves as a declaration of adherence to food safety standards in tea production."}, {"question": "Are there any specific requirements for the survey map of the tea area, particularly in terms of who can certify it and how it should be prepared?", "answer": "The scheme requires a survey map of the tea area, preferably A-4 size, to be drawn by a government-approved surveyor or the Land Revenue department. The map should be duly certified and signed by both the issuing authority and the applicant, where applicable. This ensures the accuracy and authenticity of the map."}, {"question": "How does the scheme define the concept of \"organic tea cultivation\" in the context of the PDSTG component, and what practices are encouraged?", "answer": "Organic tea cultivation refers to the cultivation of tea without the use of synthetic chemicals or pesticides. The PDSTG component encourages practices such as using organic fertilizers, practicing integrated pest management, and promoting sustainability in tea cultivation to ensure the tea is free from harmful chemicals."}, {"question": "Could you explain the significance of mechanization for individual small tea growers within the PDSTG component? How does it benefit these growers?", "answer": "Mechanization is a critical aspect of the PDSTG component. It provides small tea growers with equipment like pruning machines, mechanical harvesters, power sprayers, brush cutters, and plucking shears. These tools significantly improve efficiency, reduce labor costs, and enhance tea quality, making the entire tea cultivation process more sustainable and profitable."}, {"question": "Can you provide insights into the objectives of the \"Plantation Development for Small Tea Growers (PDSTG)\" component and how it contributes to the growth of small tea growers?", "answer": "The PDSTG component aims to enhance the production, productivity, and quality of tea among small tea growers. It promotes their overall development, encourages organic tea cultivation and climate-resilient tea, and assists in setting up their own processing units. This empowers small growers and helps them move up the value chain."}]}, "schemeId": "652d0af02a298fe1b48545cd"}}, "faqsHi": {"status": "Success", "statusCode": 200, "errorDescription": "", "error": "{}", "data": {"_id": "652d0ebc4c46bfe12b202548", "hi": null, "schemeId": "652d0af02a298fe1b48545cd"}}, "docs": {"status": "Success", "statusCode": 200, "errorDescription": "", "error": "{}", "data": {"_id": "652d0b242a298fe1b485460e", "en": {"documents_required": [{"type": "ol_list", "children": [{"type": "list_item", "children": [{"text": "Tea Board registration or identity smart card (QR-based) issued by Tea Board/ have a unique identification number generated."}]}, {"type": "list_item", "children": [{"text": "Survey map (A-4 size) of the tea area in case of individual small tea growers drawn by a government-approved surveyor/Land Revenue department duly certified and signed by both the issuing authority as well as the applicant, wherever applicable."}]}, {"type": "list_item", "children": [{"text": "Self-declaration under PPC compliance."}]}, {"type": "list_item", "children": [{"text": "Aadhar Card in case of individual/ PAN/TAN/GST registration in case of others, as applicable."}]}, {"type": "list_item", "children": [{"text": "Details of Bank Account (linked with mobile number and Aadhar) for claiming financial assistance with IFSC code (one cancelled cheque is to be uploaded)."}]}, {"type": "list_item", "children": [{"text": "Copy of recent resolution in case of SHGs/FPOs/FPCs along with the details of office bearer and members with tea area in command."}]}]}, {"type": "paragraph", "children": [{"text": "NOTE: ", "bold": true}, {"text": "Applicant (small tea growers) who does not have the identity Card issued by the Tea Board can obtain the same on the production of documents to establish the ownership of land and where title deeds are not available, a possession certificate issued by the concerned State Government from the nearest field office.
