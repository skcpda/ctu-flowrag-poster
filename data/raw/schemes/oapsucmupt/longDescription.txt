You can apply once you reach that age."}, {"question": "I am not completely destitute, but I have very low income from farming. Am I eligible for the scheme?", "answer": "While the scheme prioritizes destitute individuals, having some income from farming wouldn't necessarily disqualify you. However, your income level and overall financial situation will be assessed during the application process to determine your eligibility."}, {"question": "I used to be a farmer, but now I work as a security guard. Am I still eligible for the pension?", "answer": "No, the scheme is specifically for farmers and landless agricultural laborers. If your primary source of income is no longer related to agriculture, you wouldn't be eligible."}, {"question": "What happens to the free clothes (dhoti/saree) if I cannot attend the distribution event?", "answer": "In most cases, the clothes can be collected later from designated distribution centers.
