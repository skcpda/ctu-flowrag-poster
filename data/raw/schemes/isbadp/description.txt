The name of this welfare scheme is Inter-state Border Areas Development Programme. It is also known as ISBADP. The aims and objectives of the Inter-State Border Areas Development Programme ISBADP are to provide facilities for the socioeconomic development of the people living along the Inter-State boundary with Assam.
