In order to ensure the economic and social security of the farmers, the Government of Telangana has conceptualized and implementing an innovative scheme named as Farmers Group Life Insurance Scheme (Rythu Bima) in addition to other initiatives in the agriculture sector.

Implementation: The scheme is implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Government of Telangana

The main objective of the Farmers Group Life Insurance Scheme (Rythu Bima), is to provide financial relief and social security to the family members/ dependents, in case of the loss of a farmer’s life due to any reason. In the event of the loss of the farmer&#39;s life, their families are facing severe financial problems even for their day-to-day needs. 


The farmer&#39;s Group Life Insurance Scheme ensures financial security and relief to the bereaved members of the farmer’s family. Farmers in the age group of 18 to 59 years are eligible for enrollment under the scheme. The entire premium is paid by the government to the Life Insurance Corporation of India (The largest public sector PSU for Insurance in India).In the event of the death of the enrolled farmer due to any cause including natural death, the insured amount of 5.00 Lakhs INR (Approx. USD 6928) is deposited into the designated nominee account within (10) days.
