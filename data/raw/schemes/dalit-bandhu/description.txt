The name of this welfare scheme is Dalit Bandhu. It is also known as DALIT BANDHU. The Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a unique initiative launched by the government of Telangana to promote the economic development of families belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community. The scheme provides financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs to eligible SC families to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures, thereby creating opportunities for them to become self-reliant and improve their standard of living.


As a part of a multi-pronged approach, in addition to existing entitlements like food security, education, and social security, a different strategy with a new initiative &quot;Telangana Dalit Bandhu&quot; is introduced to intensify the level of financial assistance to SC households for the establishment of suitable income generating economic support schemes as the delivery of credit by banks in the form of loans has become a constraint.


Under the scheme, eligible families will receive financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs each, in the form of a grant, to start a small business or entrepreneurial venture. The scheme is expected to benefit over 20 lakh families in the state over the next few years. One-time capital assistance of Rs.10 lakhs per SC family is provided for all SC families as a 100% grant/subsidy to establish suitable income-generating schemes as per their choice (without bank loan linkage).


The main objective of the scheme is to reduce poverty and promote entrepreneurship among the SC community, which has historically been marginalized and faced discrimination in society. The scheme is also expected to promote inclusive growth and social development in the state. 


The Telangana government has allocated Rs. 1,000 crores for the implementation of the scheme in the first year. The scheme is expected to be implemented in a phased manner, with eligible families being identified and selected based on a set of criteria such as income level, educational qualification, and entrepreneurial skills.


Overall, the Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a path-breaking initiative that aims to uplift the socio-economic status of the SC community in Telangana.
