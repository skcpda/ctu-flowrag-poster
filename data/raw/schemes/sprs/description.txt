The monetary limit will be fixed based on the highest turnover during the last three years which may or may not be of last year provided the units installed and operating capacity has not been reduced.
•	In case there is no decrease in plant and machinery, then 50% of the highest turnover during the last 3 years reflected in the audited balance sheet will be the basis for the fixation of monetary limit.
•	In case there is a decrease in plant and machinery of more than 10%, the following will be considered:

   Where the turnover of the Enterprise has steadily increased over the last three years and the unit is in profit continuously, the Monetary Limit may be fixed at 50% of net sales turnover achieved in the last year.
   In case the Company/Partnership concern/Proprietorship unit is in loss for one year out of the past three years, their monetary limit will be fixed at 40% of their average net sales turnover.
