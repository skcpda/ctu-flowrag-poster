The Government has implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the sanitation challenges prevalent in rural areas. The primary focus of this strategy is to encourage and motivate rural communities to abandon the traditional practice of open defecation and adopt safe sanitation practices. The Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorn Swachata Puruskar (MVSSP) has been introduced as part of this initiative. The MVSSP is an annual competition that aims to identify and recognize the cleanest Gram Panchayat at various levels, including block, district, division, and state. The competition serves as a platform to evaluate the cleanliness and hygiene conditions maintained by Gram Panchayats. Factors such as waste management, sanitation infrastructure, and active community participation are taken into consideration during the evaluation process. The winners of the MVSSP at the state and divisional levels are honored by the Honorable Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh during the Independence Day celebrations each year.
