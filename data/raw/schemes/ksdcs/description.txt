> Vision of the scheme:

The artisans who form the backbone of the craft sector work in an exploitative chain of business leading them to a vicious cycle of poverty and pessimism. A huge number of artisans (mostly the male folk) are forced to abandon the craft activity due to low wage earnings and poor socio-economic status. It is felt that this scheme shall emerge as one of the most effective pathways to address the challenges being faced by the artisan community. Exposing the pass-out trainees to improved productivity procedures adopted by producer groups can lead them to better productivity and leverage their collective skill up-gradation which can help in promoting sustainable livelihoods as the artisans can gain direct access to customized production, new design development, technology-related modifications, and above all can have the pulse of market demands.
