The name of this welfare scheme is Arun Pig Development Scheme. It is also known as APDS. The scheme “Arun Pig Development Scheme” was launched by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Veterinary &amp;amp; Dairy Development, Government of Arunachal Pradesh in the financial year 2019-20 with a focus on pig rearing. Among the livestock species, the pig finds an important place as it is being reared by socio-economically weaker sections of the society especially in the states like Arunachal Pradesh where most of people prefer non-veg cuisines with special attractions for Pork. The pig as compared to other livestock species has a great potential to contribute to a faster economic return to the farmers, because of certain inherent traits like high fecundity, better-feed conversion efficiency, early maturity, and short generation interval. Pig farming also requires small investments in buildings and equipment.
Objective

  - Genetic improvement of the indigenous pigs of Arunachal Pradesh for productivity enhancement by crossbreeding with the exotic breed(s) to a desired level of combination of exotic and local inheritance,
