The name of this welfare scheme is Kaushal Vikas Yojana. It is also known as KVY. This scheme aims to address the skill gap faced by construction workers registered with the Board by providing them with access to essential training opportunities for competency development and technical advancement.

By bridging this financial gap, the initiative empowers individuals to elevate their skillsets and career prospects. The scheme targets beneficiaries such as Individual.
