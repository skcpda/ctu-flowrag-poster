The name of this welfare scheme is Arundhati Gold Scheme. It is also known as AGS. Many parts of our country are plagued with social evils surrounding the girl child, like child marriage, female foeticide, dowry etc. But the Assamese society, from time immemorial, is fortunate to be free from such evils. Though there is no dowry system prevalent in Assam, the parent of every girl desires to give something to the girl during her marriage. The parents, irrespective of their social and economic status dream to bestow their children with love, blessings and gifts. But for many, these dreams remain unfulfilled due to their economic weakness. 
Gold is always considered auspicious and an asset. The parents believe that a gift of gold ornament would enhance their daughter’s social and economic status. Objective: The Government of Assam has decided to introduce a New Scheme “ARUNDHATI” from the financial year 2019-20.
