The scheme envisages setting up of Solar Charkha Clusters which would mean a focal village and other surrounding villages in a radius of 8 to 10 Kilometres. Further, such a cluster will have 200 to 2042 beneficiaries (spinners, weavers, stitches, and other skilled artisans). Each spinner will be given two charkhas of 10 spindles each. On average, it is considered that such a cluster will have about 1000 charkhas. A cluster with full capacity will provide direct employment to 2042 artisans.\n         The Government of India has accorded approval to set up 50 such clusters with a budget of 550 Crores for 2018-19 and 2019-20.

One unit of two Solar Charkhas would produce 2.0 kg of yarn on average per day, resulting in a production of 2.0 tons per 2000 charkhas. Thus, 500 Solar Looms would be required to convert the yarn into the fabric at the maximum price of \u20b91,10,000/- per loom and subsidy @35% at \u20b938,500/- per loom and the cumulative subsidy works out to \u20b91.93 crores for 500 weavers.\n   1. Capital cost of construction of work shed with a minimum space of 20,000 sq. feet with 100% subsidy at the maximum rate of up to \u20b91.20 crore per cluster for the SPV.\n   1. Capital cost of Solar Grid of 50 KW capacity with 100% subsidy at the maximum rate upto \u20b90.40 crore per cluster for the SPV.\n   1. One-time Capital Cost Subsidy for the SPV @35% works out to a maximum of \u20b90.75 crore per Cluster for the purchase of twisting machines, dying machines, and stitching machines (500 in number) for making the unit self-sustainable and for value addition.\n\n&gt; **B.
