The name of this welfare scheme is Promotion And Development Of Tea Tourism Infrastructure In Assam. It is also known as PDTTI-ASSAM. Assam tea and the tea estates of Assam have enormous tourism prospects. However, the potentiality of tea tourism has remained unexplored in its actual terms. The tea gardens of Assam with their lush greenery, iconic bungalows, and the tanned ethnic people with their distinct rhythmic music and dance carry potentialities to attract both domestic and international tourist interests and can present a magnificent revenue opportunity to the state. Considering the enormous potentiality of tea tourism in Assam, it is proposed to develop 50 selective Tea Gardens as Tourism destinations in a Mission Mode approach.
