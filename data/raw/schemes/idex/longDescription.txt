Generally, the tranche amount for Tranche 0, 1, 2, 4 and 5 is 10%, 20%, 30%, 30%, 10% of the SPARK Grant. Once the agreement is signed, the Kick-off Tranche is released. For Tranche 3, there is no SPARK Grant, only the Matching Contribution is to be deposited by innovator. Likewise in Tranche 5, there is no Matching Contribution, only re-imbursement of funds by iDEX, DIO."}, {"question": "Why does iDEX require matching contribution from Grant winners?", "answer": "IDEX is designed to attract start-ups with innovative ideas products relevant to the Armed Services, and in this process, also create a vibrant Indian Defence manufacturing base. Meeting these objectives requires companies to have adequate capabilities to not just deliver on the product under the grant, to be able to service the equipment over its useful lifetime, and run a sustainable enterprise. iDEX would like its grant winners to expand and become self-sustaining enterprises, which requires a vibrant business plan and \u2018skin-in-the-game\u2019 from the founders. The substantial grant under SPARK from public resources are expected to be matched by matching contribution from the grant winning start-ups, to ensure the incentives are aligned with creating a viable product meeting Defence standards. The matching contribution in the Product Development Budget (PDB) is determined with varying amounts of cash, in-kind resources, and human resources, through a collaborative process between the iDEX Team and the start-up, under robust guidelines. iDEX is designed to support start-ups using public funds with the assumption that this assistance will help develop products and Indian Defence technology companies. It is assumed that start-ups competing for grants will be doing so with full faith and integrity, in the broader interest of the nation. While substantial flexibility is provided with the understanding that innovation requires prompt decision making and frequent experiments, this flexibility should not be misused or abused. Any efforts to extract excess funds from iDEX or under-report matching contribution, despite the flexibility, will be assumed to be in bad faith, and proportionate penal action will be taken, including cross-govt blacklisting for future and withdrawal of all existing grants."}, {"question": "What is product development budget and how is it worked out?", "answer": "The Product Development Budget (PDB) is an estimate of the resources required for bringing a product to deployment stage, covering capital and operating expenditures, in accordance to the guidelines issued by DIO. The PDB is the overall project cost including the SPARK Grant and Matching Contribution (Cash, In-Kind and Past Expenditure). The PDB is divided in three broad heads \u2013 Prime Costs, Primary Overheads and Secondary Overheads."}, {"question": "What all expenses are included in prime cost, primary and secondary overhead?", "answer": "Annexure Y (Product Development Budget - Categories of Expenditures) of SPARK Grant agreement defines all three heads alongwith the limits under each head for SPARK Grant as well as Matching Contribution.

Matching Contribution (MC)\nshall mean the cumulative contribution in the form of Cash, In-Kind, and Past Expenditures, made by the SPARK Grantee in accordance to the guidelines of DIO."}, {"question": "What is past expenditure matching contribution?", "answer": "Past Expenditure Matching Contribution corresponds to the monetary value (based on fair market value for intangibles or competitive market prices for others) of all expenditures incurred by the SPARK grantee company in the past specifically related to technology / product development activities, which have been showcased during the SPARK Grant selection process. Point to Note is that actual expenditure on the Product Development starts when PDS defines the problem and SPARK Grant Agreement is signed. Past Expenditure partially covers some of the CAPEX / OPEX used for core product development activities between HPSC and agreement signing period as well as CAPEX upto a year before the HPSC.\n\nThe Past Expenditure should be less than 20% of the MC for the project."}, {"question": "Who can and cannot be covered under past expenditures?", "answer": "OPEX incurred before the selection of the winner, with broad limits being adhered to and upto a reasonable proportion of Matching Contribution (less than 20%) may be considered. This form of Matching Contribution can only form a part of Prime Costs, i.e. it should not include any component that would normally be covered in Primary Overheads or Secondary Overheads. \n\nPoint to note is that iDEX does not endeavour to compensate all technology development activity of the startup.\nIt only tries and cover some of the expenses occurred in developing the technology which will be utilised for creating the product as defined by PDS.\n\nPast Expenditure needs to be ascertained by PDs/PEs at the time of preparation of Technical Appraisal and supporting documents verified at the completion of Milestone 1."}, {"question": "What is in-kind matching contribution?", "answer": "In-Kind Matching Contribution corresponds to the monetary value (based on fair market value for intangibles or competitive market prices for others) of all expenditures incurred by the SPARK Grantee company either on actuals or accruals.

The emoluments for the founder will be decided by DIO before signing the agreement.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the SPARK Grantee to prove beyond reasonable doubt that all artifacts or IP generated in the past shall be applied or reused effectively. The Grantee is required to submit the documentary evidence to DIO as and when requested by DIO."}, {"question": "What cannot be included in matching contribution in kind?", "answer": "Any amount linked with Equity of the company cannot be considered as Matching contribution or In-Kind.\nAmount linked with company's own business purpose and not directly related to iDEX-DIO project cannot be considered as In-Kind matching."}, {"question": "How is matching contribution in-kind expenditure for founder/promoter salary ", "answer": "Founders/ promoters who are working employees of the company and are involved in the iDEX Product Development process.\nFounder/ promoter who are contributing to iDEX Product Development activities but are not employees of the company.\nIf the said individual is not drawing his salary in cash, then a liability needs to be created in the audited balance sheet of the financial year under consideration. The startup may or may not clear the liability within the duration of the product development with iDEX."}, {"question": "Clarification with reference to Annexure Y of SPARK Grant Agreement", "answer": "Current practices ensure that following ceiling limit is under practice:\n\nSalary of promoter/founder has been capped at max Rs 2L PM for a maximum of two promoters/founders per startup. This overall limit will be in vogue even if the promoters/founders have more than one ongoing projects with iDEX. Hence max Rs.50000/- each for two promoters at 25% of pay will be admissible even if they are undertaking more than one project with iDEX. This will be negotiated before signing of the agreement.\nThe consideration of valuation of promoter/founder owned IP would be decided based on criticality in the project and on a case-to-case basis at the time of negotiation of the agreement for Matching Contribution. The amount admissible as MC for IP may be capped at 20% of total Matching contribution or the amount Rs. 25 Lac whichever is lower.\nPDB at the time of signing of agreement is tentative which may undergo multiple changes during the course of Product Development. In all cases, SPARK Grant will remain 1.5 CR or half (50%) the product development budget whichever is lower."}, {"question": "Clarification regarding lab infrastructure cost", "answer": "Lab utilization cost has been accepted as part of MC in Kind in case where infrastructure and manpower are not owned by the startup. An agreement with the Lab owner/management and reasonable cost for utilization has been accepted as proof.\nIn case where the lab infrastructure is owned by the startup themselves as on the date of the SPARK agreement, a cost equivalent to the rental cost may be accepted as MC in Kind based on the fair and competitive valuation for the same for the duration of the need. The valuation may be based on equipment, physical infra and manpower needed. The requirement and duration of the need may be confirmed by the PI and valuation from an independent agency may be provided by the startup themselves at the time of negotiating the agreement for Matching Contribution.\nFor the valuation of the rental cost of Lab equipment, furniture and fixtures (except land/ building), depreciated percentage value to be considered. However, notional depreciation will be accepted in cases where the equipment/ item is already depreciated. It must be noted that the total rental value cannot exceed the total cost of Lab.\nStartup may also explore the availability of such facility with iDEX registered PIs if the same is not owned by them."}, {"question": "Caps for SPARK Grants under various heads", "answer": "In a PDB, minimum 75% of SPARK Grant should be allocated to the Prime Costs and maximum 25 % of SPARK grant may be allocated toPrimary Overheads.
