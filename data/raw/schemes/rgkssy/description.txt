The name of this welfare scheme is Rajiv Gandhi Krishak Sathi Sahayta Yojana. It is also known as RGKSSY. The Rajasthan government&#39;s Rajiv Gandhi Krishak Sathi Sahayta Yojana is a critical safety net for those who keep our food system running smoothly.  Farmers, farmworkers, and market staff face inherent risks in their daily activities.  This program acknowledges those risks and provides much-needed financial assistance in times of crisis.  If an accident occurs while they&#39;re tending to crops, raising livestock, or selling their produce at market, the Yojana can help soften the financial blow.  This can mean the difference between a family being able to afford medical care and essential needs, or facing devastating hardship. The scheme targets beneficiaries such as Individual. It is specifically implemented in Rajasthan. Additionally, the nodal department is Agriculture Department.
