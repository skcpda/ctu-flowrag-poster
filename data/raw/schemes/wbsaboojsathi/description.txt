The name of this welfare scheme is Sabooj Sathi. It is also known as WBSABOOJSATHI. The Sabooj Sathi Scheme is a student welfare initiative launched by the government of West Bengal, India, to provide bicycles to students in the state. The scheme aims to promote education and empower students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, by providing them with a means of transportation to and from school.


Under the scheme, bicycles are distributed free of cost to students studying in government and government-aided schools from classes IX to XII. The scheme is implemented by the Department of School Education, West Bengal, in collaboration with the Department of Panchayats and Rural Development.


Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech of 2015-2016, announced a scheme for the distribution of bicycles to an estimated 40 lakh students studying in classes IX to XII in Government, Government Aided Schools, and Madrasahs of the State. He announced that around 25 lakh students would be covered in 2015-16 and the remaining 15 lahks in the next fiscal.


By now, this scheme is well-known as “Sabooj Sathi” as coined by Hon’ble Chief Minister herself and it reflects her desire to see young students empowered to achieve new feats in the future through the bicycles provided under the scheme. She also created the scheme logo which is firmly attached in the basket in front of the bicycle. Hon’ble CM flagged off the distribution in October 2015 from Paschim Medinipur.
