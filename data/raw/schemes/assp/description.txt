The name of this welfare scheme is Asangathita Shramik Sahayika Prakalpa. It is also known as Assp. he Government of Tripura has introduced a scheme called Asanghatita Sramik Sahayika Prakalpa (ASSP) to provide support to unorganized workers in the state. This scheme has been in operation since 2003 and has enrolled 1,09,534 workers from 19 unorganized sectors and 17 self-employment occupations until September 2019. The scheme is aimed at helping wage-employed and self-employed workers between the ages of 21 and 60 years who work in unorganized sectors and have an average family income of not more than Rs. 10,000 per month.


Under the ASSP scheme, each subscriber (worker) is required to contribute a sum of Rs. 50/- per month, and the State Government also contributes an equal matching amount of Rs. 50/- per month. The State Government/Bank pays interest on the balance at credit of a subscriber annually at the rate declared by the Government.


The total contribution, along with interest as declared from time to time, will be refunded to the workers on attaining the age of 60 years, or in the event of the account becoming inoperative due to death or permanent total disability due to accident or loss of two eyes or two limbs or loss of one eye or one limb in an accident or prolonged default in making contributions. 


In summary, the ASSP scheme provides a financial safety net for unorganized workers in Tripura. Eligible workers can enroll by paying a monthly contribution of Rs. 50, which is matched by the State Government. The contributions earn interest, and the total amount, including interest, is refunded to the workers when they reach the age of 60 years, or in the event of the account becoming inoperative due to certain circumstances.
