The name of this welfare scheme is Udyogini Scheme. It is also known as US. Started in the year 1997-1998 (and amended in the year 2004-2005), Udyogini is an innovative scheme sanctioned by the Government of Karnataka to assist women in gaining self-reliance and economic independence through self-employment, mainly through trade and the service sector. It also provides for a subsidy on loans from the Karnataka State Women’s Development Corporations for undertaking business activities/ micro enterprises through banks and other financial institutions. Loans are disbursed through financial institutions like commercial banks, district cooperative banks, and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). 


In absence of a structured credit system, women would take loans from private borrowers and end up paying a high rate of interest. Hence, there was felt a need to have in place formal channels of credit which are accessible to women. Profitable business activities are approved and supported under this scheme. They may be bookbinding and notebooks manufacturing, chalk and crayon manufacture, jam, jelly, pickles manufacture, papad manufacture, saree, and embroidery work, printing and dyeing of clothes, and woolen weaving, amongst others. Udyogini gives adequate opportunities to such women to help them be self-employed. The scheme targets beneficiaries such as Individual. It is specifically implemented in Karnataka.
