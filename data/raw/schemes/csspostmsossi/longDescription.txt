Could you clarify how income is assessed when a student has one or both parents alive, and what happens if both parents have passed away?", "answer": "When either of the parents (or the husband in the case of married unemployed girl students) is alive, only their income should be considered, excluding the income of other family members, even if they are earning. However, when both parents (or the husband in the case of married but unemployed girl students) have passed away, the income of the guardian who is supporting the student in their studies should be considered.

There are no restrictions on accepting these forms of support in conjunction with the scholarship."}, {"question": "Can scholarship recipients hold other scholarships or stipends concurrently, and if not, how do they choose between them?", "answer": "Scholarship recipients cannot hold multiple scholarships or stipends simultaneously under this scheme. If they are awarded more than one scholarship or stipend, they must select the one that is more beneficial to them. The process for making this selection involves informing the awarding authority through the Head of the Institution. Once a scholarship is accepted, no further scholarships can be received."}, {"question": "I'm curious about the eligibility for post-graduate courses in medicine. Could you elaborate on the condition related to practicing during the course?", "answer": "Eligibility for pursuing post-graduate courses in medicine under this scholarship is contingent on the student not being allowed to practice during the period of their course. This condition is essential for determining their eligibility."}, {"question": "Can you explain the income criteria for unemployed applicants, specifically regarding their parents or guardians' income?", "answer": "Unemployed applicants are eligible if their parents or guardians' income from all sources does not exceed Rs. 1.50 lakh per annum.
