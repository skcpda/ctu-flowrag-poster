The name of this welfare scheme is Mumkin - Livelihood Generation Scheme. It is also known as MLGS. &quot;Mumkin - Livelihood Generation Scheme&quot; is an initiative launched by the Jammu &amp; Kashmir State specifically aimed at empowering its young population. Recognizing the challenges faced by unemployed youth, this program offers financial assistance to help them embark on their journey towards self-employment. By providing subsidies and facilitating bank loans, Mumkin removes a significant financial barrier for aspiring young entrepreneurs, allowing them to invest in small commercial vehicles and establish themselves within the transportation sector. This not only fosters self-reliance among Jammu &amp; Kashmir&#39;s youth but also injects fresh energy and resources into the local economy. The scheme targets beneficiaries such as Individual. It is specifically implemented in Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, the nodal department is Mission Youth.
