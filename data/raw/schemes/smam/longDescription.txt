Promote farm mechanization among stakeholders by way of on-field and off-field training and demonstrations.\n1. Provide financial assistance to farmers for procurement of farm machinery and implements.\n1. Establish custom hiring centres of the location and crop-specific farm machinery and implements.\n1. Provide financial assistance to small and marginal farmers for hiring machinery and implements in low-mechanized regions.\n\n<br>\n\n**Mission Components**\n\n1. Promotion and Strengthening of Agricultural Mechanization through Training, Testing and Demonstration.\n1. Demonstration, Training and Distribution of Post-Harvest Technology and Management (PHTM).\n1. Financial Assistance for Procurement of Agriculture Machinery and Equipment.\n1. Establish Farm Machinery Banks for Custom Hiring.\n1. Establish Hi-Tech, High Productive Equipment Hub for Custom Hiring.\n1. Promotion of Farm Mechanization in Selected Villages.\n1.
