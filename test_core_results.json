Under this scheme, eligible farmers receive Rs. 6000 per year in three equal installments. The amount is transferred directly to their bank accounts. To be eligible, farmers must own agricultural land. The land should be in their name or in the name of their family members. Small and marginal farmers are the primary beneficiaries of this scheme. The scheme aims to supplement the financial needs of farmers for procuring inputs. Farmers can use this money for seeds, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs. The application process is simple and can be done online through the PM-KISAN portal. Farmers need to provide their Aadhaar number and bank account details. The scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. For more information, contact the nearest agriculture office or call the helpline.",
